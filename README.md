this is made to be super simple and having no features is part of the design

# how to install?
make sure that rust and git are installed:

1. git clone https://github.com/Shadyshift/ls-rustified/
2.  cd ls-rustified
3. cargo run 


# why?
Because it is very simple and very tiny. the function of ls is very simple, so the code needs to be also very simple. And because I am still learning rust and this is a cool project! :D
